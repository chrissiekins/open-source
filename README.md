# Reimagine github.com/open-source 

GitHub is the largest host of open source code in the world. Open source is an important part of the GitHub story, but the current github.com/open-source doesn't reflect that. Instead of highlighting open source as the core pillar of GitHub's value, the page treats it more like a feature. The design of the page also feels disconnected from the rest of the GitHub website. The page needs a refresh so that it more accurately reflects GitHub, both in look and in message. The page should be SEO-optimized to not only attract general open source queries but visitors interested in contributing to open source projects on GitHub.

This page has prime internet real estate with a URL like github.com/open-source, so in addition to making the page *feel* like GitHub, it should also serve as a pillar page that anchors the rest of the valuable open source content available on the site.

## Proposition

* Make github.com/open-source an awareness-level page that not only defines what open source is, but GitHub's essential role in it.

* Highlight GitHub as the premier place for contributing to and hosting open source projects. GitHub hosts more open source projects than any other site. Open source is at the heart of what makes GitHub, well, GitHub.

* Provide resources throughout the page to other open source content available on github.com. This page should serve as a pillar for GitHub's open source messaging and content. As a prime URL, it should be natural for visitors to find what they need about GitHub and open source from here.

* Update the UI of the page to align more with the rest of the site. 

* Encourage visitors to sign up for GitHub, and/or start exploring open source projects.

## Resources needed

* Feature a new, animated hero banner that reflects the millions of developers contributing to open source projects every day.

* A new layout that features scroll-triggered animations for each section.

* An updated page layout and color scheme inspired by the current github.com/enterprise page.
