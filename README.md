# Reimagine github.com/open-source 

GitHub is the largest host of open source code in the world. Open source is an important part of the GitHub story, but the current github.com/open-source doesn't reflect that. Instead of highlighting open source as the core pillar of GitHub's value, the page treats it more like a feature. The design of the page also feels disconnected from the rest of the GitHub brand. 

This page has prime internet real estate with a URL like github.com/open-source, so in addition to making the page *feel* like GitHub, it should also serve as a pillar page that anchors the rest of the valuable open source content available on GitHub.

## Proposition

* Make github.com/open-source an awareness-level page that explains what open source is and why it's valuable.

* Create a timeline of open source that highlights key milestones in open source software development.

* Highlight GitHub as the place developers trust to host their open source projects, how GitHub creates a platform for collaborating on open source projects, and how open source is what makes GitHub, GitHub.

* Provide resources throughout the page to other open source content available on github.com.

* Encourage visitors to sign up for GitHub, and/or start exploring open source projects.
